# Calculator

This is the capstone project of the Foundations Course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an amazing open-source resource for learning web development.

What I've produced is a based off of how my own cheap pocket calculator does math. A lot of testing has been done, but bugs might still be present. Even though the project requires the calculator to handle only one pair of numbers at a time, I have cheated, because I wanted the user to get some results by pressing `=` repeatedly.  

With physical calculators, some operations are optimized for the consumer's (who is not a mathematician or an engineer) day-to-day usage, including [percentages](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080110-00/?p=23853). 

## Overview

I've made this to train my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Extended Functionality**: Supports floating-point calculations and error handling for a robust user experience.
- **Memory Functions**: Mimics the functionality of a physical calculator with buttons such as:
  - **M**emory Addition (`M+`); 
  - **M**emory Subtraction (`M-`);
  - **C**lear **E**ntry (`CE`); 
  - **A**ll **C**lear (`AC`);
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Keyboard Support**: Facilitates keyboard input for improved accessibility and ease of use.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running:

### Prerequisites

- Any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
- A basic text editor like VSCode or Sublime Text.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafa-net/calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the calculator.

## Usage

Click on the numbers as you would with the Windows calculator. Keyboard mappings are as follows:

- `Shift + A` clears everything (including memory)
- `Shift + C` clears the current entry, but keeps the first number in the operation so you can correct the second one
- `Backspace` deletes the last digit from the on-screen number
- `Shift + S` does square roots
- `Shift + P` does powers of two

## Contributing

I am relatively new to open source endeavours, but as usual, any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
