# Calculator Project

This repository contains the source code for a simple yet powerful calculator web application. This is the capstone project of the Foundations Course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an amazing open-source resource for learning web development.

## Overview

I've made this to show my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating my ability to create functional, interactive web applications. This calculator not only supports basic arithmetic operations but also integrates advanced features for enhanced usability.

### Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Extended Functionality**: Supports floating-point calculations and error handling for a robust user experience.
- **Memory Functions**: Mimics the functionality of a physical calculator with options to clear the current entry (CE) and reset all operations (AC).
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Keyboard Support**: Facilitates keyboard input for improved accessibility and ease of use.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running:

### Prerequisites

- A basic text editor like VSCode or Sublime Text.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rafa-net/calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the calculator.

## Usage

combineAllThree this calculator as you would with any standard device:

1. Interact with the on-screen buttons or utilize keyboard inputs for operations.
2. Use "CE" to clear the last entry and "AC" for resetting the calculator.
